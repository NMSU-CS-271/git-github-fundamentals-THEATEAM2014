Objective:
  Create a new markdown file, named README.md, in this repository (the name matters!). Let your instructors know what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!

Answer:
  I have learned pretty much everything that was written in the document. I've never really used github besides downloading files from the site. I am still confused on how the assignments will work with github classroom but I have a feeling I will understand it soon.
